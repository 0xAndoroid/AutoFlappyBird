# AutoFlappyBird
 
Just a flappy bird game which is played by a neural network.

Written on Java with <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">LibGDX</a>

In game you can see 4 information labels:
- Alive birds in top left corner
- Number of generation in top center
- Score in down left corner
- Max score in doen center

Controls:
- Speed: number keys from 1-5 and super speed mode on key 6; also a stop on key 0
- Escape for save and exit
- Backspace for clear the data about neural network - start everything from very beginning
- Alt+Backspace same as Backspace but with exit from app

Project is finished but I welcome all proposal messages.
